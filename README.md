# Gulf-of-Alaska-climate-index
This repository contain the scripts and workflow needed to compute the Northern Gulf of Alaska Oscillation (NGAO, see Hauri et al., 2021)   and the Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI, see Hauri et al., 2021). 


The Northern Gulf of Alaska Oscillation (NGAO) index describes the strength of the cyclonic circulation in the Gulf of Alaska, and therefore, the intensity of the offshore upwelling in the Alaskan gyre and coastal downwelling (Hauri et al., 2021). The NGAO corresponds to the primary mode of variability, identified through Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition performed on SSH anomalies (with trends and monthly climatology removed). This first mode accounts for approximately 24 % of the total variance and explains about 50 % of the SSH variance in offshore areas.



The Gulf of Alaska Downwelling Index (GOADI) quantifies the intensity of positive coastal SSH anomalies in the Gulf of Alaska, indicating the strength of coastal downwelling (Hauri et al., 2024). This index is derived from the second mode of variability identified by Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decomposition, applied to SSH anomalies after removing trends and monthly climatology. While this second mode accounts for approximately 10 % of the total variance, it explains approximately 60 % of the SSH variance on the continental shelf area.
